<h2>Bindings</h2>  
<p>
        For reasons we're ashamed to divulge we can only
        show you the current bindings from a browser
        that connects to a currently-running Dred.

<p>
        Please use the <b>Browse Help with Mozilla</b> 
        or the <b>Show Bindings</b> menu entries to see the
        current state of the bindings of the current editing
        session.
