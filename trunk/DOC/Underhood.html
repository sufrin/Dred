<h3>Unix Scripts</h3>
The scripts <tt>dred</tt> and <tt>ted</tt> are very simple, and 
I don't much care what you decide to call them.
<pre>
        #!/bin/sh
        # usage: dred [switches] <i>files</i>
        exec java -jar $HOME/bin/Dred.jar "$@" &
</pre>
<pre>
        #!/bin/sh
        # usage: ted [switches] <i>files</i>
        exec java -jar $HOME/bin/Dred.jar --wait "$@" 
</pre>

<h3>Starting in Server Mode</h3>

In server mode the program listens for
HTTP1.0 requests to start editing sessions. 

The program can be started in server mode by invoking:
</p>
        
<pre>
        java -jar Dred.jar --serve[=####] <i>files</i>
</pre>
<p>
If the port number (=####) appears, and the given port is not currently in use,
then the program starts serving the current user on that port. 
If the port number appears, and the given port responds to an inquiry 
that indicates that a Dred server
is operating at that port, then editing sessions
are started on that server for the files; otherwise it finds an unused port, starts serving on that,
and starts editing sessions on that server for the files.
</p>

<p>
To discover what port the most-recently activated Dred server is 
active on use the command
<pre>
        java -jar Dred.jar --serving
</pre>
which succeeds (Unix exit 0) and outputs the port number
if there is an active server, and fails (Unix exit 1) and outputs 0 otherwise.
</p>

<h3>Server Requests</h3>

<p>
        An editing request takes the form
</p>

<pre>
        GET /edit?CWD=<i>workingdirectory</i>&amp;FILE=<i>absolutefilename</i>&amp;WAIT=<b>true</b><i> or </i><b>false</b>&amp;ENCODING=<i>encoding name</i>
</pre>

<p>
The <tt>WAIT</tt> and <tt>ENCODING</tt> parameters can be omitted, in which case they
are taken, respectively, to be <tt><b>false</b></tt>, and <tt><b>UTF8</b></tt>.
</p>
<p>
The server responds by starting an editing session for the given file using the
given working directory as the session's effective working directory.
</p>
<p>
If <tt>WAIT</tt> is true, then when the session is terminated an HTTP response 
is generated; otherwise the HTTP response is generated immediately.
</p>
<p>
The given <tt>ENCODING</tt> is taken to be the encoding of the file. 
</p>

<p>The server also honours requests for Dred's documentation files. The 
<b>Help/Browse Help with Mozilla</b> (etc) menu actions are implemented
by aiming the browser at Dred's built-in server port (<i>####</i>), using the command:
<pre>
        mozilla http://localhost:<i>####</i>/index.html
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Logging Server</h3>
Dred has an internal event-logging system that is intended to be
used when debugging without an IDE. The system can be controlled
from a browser.  You can start Dred's internal logging server
from the <b>File/Preferences/Start&nbsp;Log"</b> menu (you need to
provide a port number (####) in the Argument minitext), and connect to it as
<tt>localhost:####/</tt>. You'll get back a panel (implemented as an HTML
form) that lets you control the level of detail of the logging output,
and lets you inspect the last few thousand logging events incrementally.

<h3>Windows</h3>
<p> It's possible, though not much use, to run Dred in server mode on
Windows. By preventing the opening of local ports without administrator
permission XP Service pack 2 makes it slightly tedious to do this.
The best thing to do (if you are sure you want a proper server and not a
pseudo-server) is to allocate a fixed port for Dred and make appropriate
arrangements with the administrator to unblock that port. If your
administrator wants to know why this is secure, explain that Dred only
accepts connections from the host on which it's running.  </p>
