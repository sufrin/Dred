<h3>Unix Scripts</h3>
The scripts <tt>dred</tt> and <tt>ted</tt> are very simple, and 
I don't much care what you decide to call them.
<pre>
        #!/bin/sh
        # usage: dred [switches] filenames
        exec java -jar $HOME/bin/Dred.jar "$@" &
</pre>
<pre>
        #!/bin/sh
        # usage: ted [switches] filenames
        exec java -jar $HOME/bin/Dred.jar --wait "$@" 
</pre>

<h3>Starting in Server Mode</h3>

In server mode the program listens for
HTTP1.0 requests to start editing sessions. 

The program can be started in server mode by invoking:
</p>
        
<pre>
        java -jar Dred.jar --serve[=####]
</pre>
<p>
If the port number (=####) appears, and the given port is not currently in use,
then the program starts serving the current user on that port; otherwise it finds an unused port, 
and starts serving on that.
</p>

<p>
To discover what port the most-recently activated Dred server is 
active on use the command
<pre>
        java -jar Dred.jar --serving
</pre>
which succeeds (Unix exit 0) and outputs the port number
if there is an active server, and fails (Unix exit 1) and outputs 0 otherwise.
</p>

<h3>Server Requests</h3>

<p>
        An editing request takes one of the forms:
</p>

<pre>
        GET /edit?CWD=workingdirectory&amp;FILE=absolutefilename&amp;WAIT=true
        GET /edit?CWD=workingdirectory&amp;FILE=absolutefilename
</pre>

<p>
The server responds by starting an editing session for the given file using the
given working directory as the session's effective working directory.
</p>
<p>
If the first form is used, then when the session is terminated an HTTP response 
is generated; otherwise the HTTP response is generated immediately.
</p>

<p>The server also honours requests for Dred's documentation files. The 
<b>Help/Browse Help with Mozilla</b> (etc) menu actions are implemented
by aiming the browser at Dred's built-in server port.
</p>

<h3>Logging Server</h3>
Dred has an internal event-logging system that is intended to be
used when debugging without an IDE. The system can be controlled
from a browser.  You can start Dred's internal logging server
from the <b>File/Preferences/Start&nbsp;Log"</b> menu (you need to
provide a port number (####) in the Argument minitext), and connect to it as
<tt>localhost:####/</tt>. You'll get back a panel (implemented as an HTML
form) that lets you control the level of detail of the logging output,
and lets you inspect the last few thousand logging events incrementally.
