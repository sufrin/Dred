        Dred

<p> Dred is an lightweight, customizeable, and extensible Unicode text
editor, written in Java 1.5.  
</p>

<h2>Unix/Linux Usage</h2>
<pre>
        java -jar Dred.jar [--bindings=<i>bindings-url</i>] --wait [filenames] 
</pre> 
or 
<pre>
        java -jar Dred.jar [--bindings=<i>bindings-url</i>] -w [filenames] 
</pre>
or        
<pre>
        ted [--bindings=<i>bindings-url</i>] [filenames]
</pre>  
<p> This starts edit sessions (using the bindings specified in the file
at the given url, or the default bindings if none are specified) for
each of the given filenames.  The program exits when the last session
terminates.  </p>
<pre>
        java -jar Dred.jar [--bindings=<i>bindings-url</i>] [filenames]  &amp;
</pre>  
or        
<pre>
        dred [--bindings=<i>bindings-url</i>] [filenames]
</pre>  
<p>
This starts edit sessions for each of the given filenames, using an
existing Dred server if one is running, then exits immediately. If no
server is running then it starts itself in server mode, puts up an
(iconified) server control, and starts edit sessions for the
filenames.

<h2>Windows Usage
</h2>

<p>   Make a shortcut to Dred.jar in the distribution directory. It makes
   sense for this shortcut to be placed somewhere on your desktop.
</p>

<p>   Make sure that the &quot;Start in&quot; directory in the shortcut is something
   sensible (your desktop, for example).
</p>

<p>   
Don't (yet) try to use the formatting entries on the Etc menu.
</p>


<h2>The Dred Editing Session Window</h2>
<p> In each editing session window you will see the main document-editing
component at the bottom, with three &quot;minitext&quot;-editing components
in a row above it. The minitexts are labelled &quot;....&quot; (pronounced
&quot;Argument&quot;), &quot;Find&quot; and &quot;Repl&quot;. Many of the editing commands
described below can also be used on the minitexts.  </p>

<p> The <i>Find</i> and <i>Replace</i> minitexts provide arguments for
the actions of the same name.  </p>

<p> The <i>Argument</i> minitext provides arguments for many of the other
editing commands, including those on the <i>File</i> menu which start
new editing sessions, allow the document to be saved in a different file,
and so forth.  </p>

<p>Dred shows which of its (mini-)text windows has the keyboard focus
by showing its cursor in red. A text window with a greyed-out cursor
doesn't have the keyboard focus.  Focus usually moves into a text window
as the mouse-cursor moves into it, but occasionally it's necessary to force
the issue by clicking in the desired window.  </p>

<h2>Editing Model</h2>

<p> At any stage, the document in a window (minitext or main) may have
a <i>selection</i> (which is a contiguous region of the document).
It is bounded at one end by the <i>document cursor</i> -- which is shown
as a thin red rectangle -- and at the other end by the <i>mark</i> --
which is shown as a thin green rectangle. When the cursor and mark are
in the same position only the cursor is shown, and the selection (in that
document) is effectively empty.</p>


<p>The document cursor is moved by the arrow keys. It can be placed
anywhere in the document by clicking with the left mouse-button.  The mark
can be placed anywhere in the document by clicking on the right mouse
button. </p>


<p>The selection is always shown on a grey background.</p>

<p> After every editing action the position of the document in the
editor window is adjusted automatically so that <i>the document cursor
is visible.</i> Between editing commands the position of the  document
in the window can be adjusted manually by the scroll bars, and this can
make the document cursor disappear temporarily.  </p>


<p> There is a <i>cut-buffer</i> which holds at most one text. It is
implemented by the system clipboard, and material placed in the cut
buffer is also available in the clipboard. Moreover, material placed in
the system clipboard by another application is accessible through the
cut buffer.  </p>


<p>Typing new characters removes the mark, and thus deselects the
<i>selection</i>, but does not delete the selected material. This is
deliberate: the &quot;typing deletes selection&quot; behaviour that  most
people have come to expect of editors leads to many irritating little
accidents.</p>

<h2>Editing Actions</h2>
<p> The editing actions described below are a small selection of the
actions provided by the editor. Brief documentation for <i>all</i> the actions,
and indications of their current binding(s) to keys and/or Menu buttons
can be seen by pressing the <b>Help/Show Bindings</b> menu item. 
</p>
(see also <A href="Bindings.html">Further documentation of bindings</A>)


<h3>Cut and Paste</h3>
<p>The <i>Cut</i> action removes the selection from the document and puts
it in the cut-buffer.  The <i>Paste</i> action reinserts the content of
the cut-buffer into the document and re-selects it. The <i>Copy</i> action
replaces the cut-buffer with the selection (if there is a selection),
and the <i>SwapSel</i> action exchanges the selection and the cut-buffer (except
that if the selection is null, then the cut-buffer doesn't change).  The
<i>SwapCursorAndMark</i> action does what its name suggests.
</p>

<h3>Search and Replace</h3>
<p>
The three minitexts at the top of an editing window are called the <i>....</i>
(or <i>Argument</i>),
the <i>Find</i>, and the <i>Replace</i> texts, respectively.
</p>

<p>
The <i>FindDown</i> action selects the next (<i>FindUp</i> previous) instance of the
<i>Find</i> text. The <i>Edit</i> menu has radiobuttons on it that
control the interpretation of the pattern as literal or regular expression.
</p>

<p> <b>If the current selection is an instance of the Find text </b>
then the <i>ReplaceDown</i> action saves the current selection in the
cut-buffer and replaces it with the <i>Repl</i> text -- leaving the
cursor to the right of the mark. The <i>ReplaceUp</i> button does the
same, but leaves the cursor to the left of the mark.  </p>

<p>The <i>FindUp</i> action is usually bound to the SHIFTED key that
the <i>FindDown</i> action is bound to; likewise the <i>ReplaceUp</i>
action is usually bound to the SHIFTED <i>ReplaceDown</i> key.  </p>

<p>The <i>Literal Replace</i> button on the Edit menu controls whether the
content is interpreted as a regexp substitution (<tt>$n</tt> replaces the
<tt>n</tt>th bracketed expression in the pattern) or as a literal.  </p>

<p> The <i>FindSelDown</i> action makes the current selection the
<i>Find</i> text, then acts as the <i>FindDown</i> action. Likewise
<i>FindSelUp</i> makes the current selection the <i>Find</i> text,
then acts as the <i>FindUp</i> action.  </p>

<p>The <i>ClearArgument</i> action moves the keyboard focus
into the Argument minitext area and erases the text that is
there. <i>ClearFind</i>, and <i>ClearRepl</i> behave analogously in the
Find and Repl minitexts.</p>



<h3>Undoing</h3>
<p>
For the moment there is no <i>general</i> mechanism for undoing. But
when the selection is non-null:
</p>

<pre>
        <i>Cut</i>      is undone by <i>Paste</i> 
                
        <i>SwapSel</i>  is undone by <i>SwapSel</i>
</pre>
 
and, whether or not the selection is null:     
<pre>
        <i>Paste</i>    is undone by <i>Cut</i> 
</pre>
<p>
Moreover if the selection is an instance of the Find text then 
</p>

<pre>
        <i>Replace</i>         is undone by <i>SwapSel</i>
</pre>
<p>
The  <i>Delete</i> action simply removes the character to the left of
the cursor from the document without affecting the cut buffer.
</p>

<p>
The  <i>Swap2</i> action swaps the two characters immediately to the left
of the cursor without affecting the cut buffer.
</p>

<p>The Dred document editing model is essentially that established in my
(1981) Science of Computer Programming paper: 
&quot;Formal Specification of a Display-Oriented Text Editor&quot;.
