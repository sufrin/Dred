<h1>
Dred 
</h1>

<p> Dred is an lightweight, customizeable, and extensible Unicode text
editor, written in Java 1.5.  
</p>

<h2>Unix/Linux Usage</h2>
<pre>
        java -jar Dred.jar [-bindings=url] [filenames]  
</pre>  
<p>
This starts edit sessions (using the bindings specified, or the default
bindings if none are specified) for each of the given filenames.
The program exits when the last session terminates.
</p>

<p>If the Dred launcher (ted/dred) has been installed then the
following commands are available:</p>
<pre>
        dred [filenames]      
</pre>      
<p>
This starts edit sessions for the named files using the Dred server.
The <tt>dred</tt> command exits immediately; the server continues.
</p>
                             
<pre>
        ted  [filename]
</pre>
<p>
This starts an edit session for the named file using the Dred server.
The ted command exits when the session terminates.     
</p>
<p>
(see also <A href="#hood">Under the Hood</A>)
</p>
                
<h2>Windows Usage
</h2>

<p>   Make a shortcut to Dred.jar in the distribution directory. It makes
   sense for this shortcut to be placed somewhere on your desktop.
</p>

<p>   Make sure that the ''Start in'' directory in the shortcut is something
   sensible (your desktop, for example).
</p>

<p>   
Don't (yet) try to use the shell or formatting entries on the Etc menu.
</p>


<h2>The Dred Window</h2>
<p>
In the Dred window you will see the main document-editing component at the bottom, with
three ''minitext''-editing components in a row above it. The minitexts are labelled
''....'' (pronounced ''Argument''), ''Find'' and ''Repl''. Many of the editing
commands described below can also be used on the minitexts.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Argument</i> minitext provides arguments for many of the other editing
commands, including those on the <i>File</i> menu which start new editing
sessions, allow the document to be saved in a different file, and
so forth.
</p>

<p>Dred shows which of its (mini-)text windows has the keyboard focus by showing
its cursor in red. A text window with a greyed-out cursor doesn't have the keyboard focus.
Focus usually moves into a text window as the mouse-cursor moves into it; occasionally
it's necessary to force the issue by clicking in the desired window. 
</p>


<h2>Editing Model</h2>

<p>
At any stage, the document may have a <i>selection</i> (which is
a contiguous region of the document).  It is bounded at one end by the
<i>document cursor</i> -- which is shown as a thin red rectangle --
and at the other end by the <i>mark</i> -- which is shown as a thin
green rectangle. When the cursor and mark are in the same position only
the cursor is shown, and the selection is effectively empty.
</p>

<p>The document cursor is moved by the arrow keys. It can be placed
anywhere in the document by clicking with the left mouse-button with the
mouse-cursor in the  intended position.  The mark can be placed anywhere
in the document by clicking on the right mouse button.</p>

<p>The selection is always shown on a grey background.</p>

<p> After every editing action the position of the document in the
editor window is adjusted automatically so that <i>the document cursor
is visible.</i> Between editing commands the position of the  document
in the window can be adjusted manually by the scroll bars, and this can
make the document cursor disappear temporarily.  </p>


<p> There is a <i>cut-buffer</i> which holds at most one text. It is
implemented by the system clipboard, and material placed in the cut
buffer is also available in the clipboard. Moreover, material placed in
the system clipboard by another application is accessible through the
cut buffer.  </p>


<p>Typing new characters removes the mark, and thus deselect the
<i>selection</i>, but does not delete the selected material. This is
deliberate: the ''typing deletes selection'' behaviour that  most
people have come to expect of editors leads to many irritating little
accidents.</p>

<h2>Editing Actions</h2>
<p> The editing actions described below are a small selection of the
actions provided by the editor. Brief documentation for <i>all</i> the actions,
and indications of their current binding(s) to keys and/or Menu buttons
can be seen by pressing the <tt>Help/Show Bindings</tt> menu item. 
</p>
(see also <A href="#bindings">Further documentation of bindings</A>)


<h3>Cut and Paste</h3>
<p>The <i>Cut</i> action removes the selection from the document and puts
it in the cut-buffer.  The <i>Paste</i> action reinserts the content of
the cut-buffer into the document and re-selects it. The <i>Copy</i> action
replaces the cut-buffer with the selection (if there is a selection),
and the <i>SwapSel</i> action exchanges the selection and the cut-buffer (except
that if the selection is null, then the cut-buffer doesn't change).  The
<i>SwapCursorAndMark</i> action does what its name suggests.
</p>

<h3>Search and Replace</h3>
<p>
The three minitexts at the top of an editing window are called the <i>....</i>
(or <i>Argument</i>),
the <i>Find</i>, and the <i>Replace</i> texts, respectively.
</p>

<p>
The <i>FindDown</i> action selects the next (<i>FindUp</i> previous) instance of the
<i>Find</i> text. The <i>Edit</i> menu has radiobuttons on it that
control the interpretation of the pattern as literal or regular expression.
</p>

<p> <b>If the current selection is an instance of the Find text </b>
then the <i>ReplaceDown</i> action saves the current selection in the
cut-buffer and replaces it with the <i>Repl</i> text -- leaving the
cursor to the right of the mark. The <i>ReplaceUp</i> button does the
same, but leaves the cursor to the left of the mark.  </p>

<p>The <i>FindUp</i> action is usually bound to the SHIFTED key that
the <i>FindDown</i> action is bound to; likewise the <i>ReplaceUp</i>
action is usually bound to the SHIFTED <i>ReplaceDown</i> key.  </p>

<p>The <i>Literal Replace</i> button on the Edit menu controls whether the
content is interpreted as a regexp substitution (<tt>$n</tt> replaces the
<tt>n</tt>th bracketed expression in the pattern) or as a literal.  </p>

<p> The <i>FindSelDown</i> action makes the current selection the
<i>Find</i> text, then acts as the <i>FindDown</i> action. Likewise
<i>FindSelUp</i> makes the current selection the <i>Find</i> text,
then acts as the <i>FindUp</i> action.  </p>

<p>The <i>ClearArgument</i> action moves the keyboard focus
into the Argument minitext area and erases the text that is
there. <i>ClearFind</i>, and <i>ClearRepl</i> behave analogously in the
Find and Repl minitexts.</p>



<h3>Undoing</h3>
<p>
For the moment there is no <i>general</i> mechanism for undoing. But
when the selection is non-null:
</p>

<pre>
        <i>Cut</i>             is undone by <i>Paste</i> 
                
        <i>Swap Clipboard</i>  is undone by <i>Swap Clipboard</i>
</pre>
 
and, whether or not the selection is null:     
<pre>
        <i>Paste</i>           is undone by <i>Cut</i> 
</pre>
<p>
Moreover if the selection is an instance of the Find text then 
</p>

<pre>
        <i>Replace</i>         is undone by <i>Swap Clipboard</i>
</pre>
<p>
The  <i>Delete</i> action simply removes the character to the left of
the cursor from the document without affecting the cut buffer.
</p>

<p>
The  <i>Swap2</i> action swaps the two characters immediately to the left
of the cursor without affecting the cut buffer.
</p>

<h2>Bindings, Extensibility and Customizeability</h2>
Dred has extensive provisions for extensibility: these will be documented
in due course.
<p>     Dred's built-in components and extensions are configured from
        ''bindings'' files that take a standard form. The most important
        function of configuration (for most users) is the association
        of keystrokes with editing actions.
</p>


<h3>Initial Bindings</h3>
When the program starts, then if no bindings file is specified on its command line with the
switch

<pre>
<code>
        -bindings=<i>url</i>
</code>
</pre>
it attempts to read a bindings file from the first of the following url-specified
files that exists:

<pre>
<code>
        $(DREDBINDINGS)                         (<i>if the environment variable <tt>DREDBINDINGS</tt> exists</i>)
        file:$(HOME)/.dred/dred.bindings        (<i><tt>$(HOME)</tt> stands for the user's desktop in Windows</i>)
</code>
</pre>
<p>
If it cannot do so, then it issues a warning on the console and
uses its inbuilt ''fallback'' bindings. Most people will find that
these bindings do not suit them. 
</p>

<p>     A Bindings file is <tt>UTF8</tt>-encoded and contains a sequence of <tt>Binding</tt>
        descriptions together with some comments. 
</p>   
<p>    
        A comment is a line whose first non-blank character is <code>#</code>
</p>

<p>        
        A binding description is a sequence of binding fields separated
        by spaces and followed by an optional comment that starts with <code>#</code>
        and extends to the end of the line. 
</p>

<p>     A binding field is a sequence of non-space characters. Within
        a binding field: <code>\#</code> stands for <code>#</code>,
        <code>\s</code> stands for space, <code>\t</code> stands for a
        tab character, <code>\n</code> stands for a newline character,
        and a sequence of the form <code>\u</code><i>XXXX</i> (where
        <i>XXXX</i> are hexadecimal characters) stands for the character
        at unicode <i>XXXX</i>.
</p>

<p>     Extensions are expected to provide their own documentation
        of the way in which they use bindings,
        but (in general) the first field of a binding indicates the
        name of the extension (or component) that is expected to
        interpret it, the second field of a binding indicates the
        type of interpretation, and subsequent fields are there
        to be interpreted.
</p>

<p>     
        The principal built-in component types are 
</p>
<ul>    <li>Text-editing windows. There are at least four of
        these per editing session, namely the document-editing
        window and the <tt>....</tt> (<tt>Argument</tt>),
        <tt>Find</tt>, and <tt>Repl</tt> minitexts. (Others may
        appear on customizeable buttons on the style-buttons tool and
        other extensions.)   Their behaviour is defined by the class
        <tt>org.sufrin.dred.SimpleEditor</tt>.       
        Bindings take one of the forms
        <pre>
        <code>text action</code> <i>TextActionName</i> <i>keystroke description</i>
        <code>text abbrev</code> <i>abbreviation</i>   <i>insertion</i>
        <code>text key</code>    <i>insertion</i>      <i>keystroke description</i>
        <code>text abbrev</code> <i>abbreviation</i>   <i>insertion</i> <i>keystroke description</i>
        </pre>        
        
        
        <p>
        The first of these forms binds the specified text action to the given keystroke
        in all editing components (including the main document
        editor and the minitexts). The second
        form associates an abbreviation with an insertion. The text <tt>doAbbrev</tt>
        action finds finds the longest abbreviation match that ends at the
        cursor, and replaces it with the corresponding insertion text.   
        The third associates the given keystroke with the insertion of a specific
        piece of text. It is intended to support the insertion of ''national characters''
        when Dred is run on an operating system that doesn't provide built-in support for
        special character input. The final form combines the effect of the second and third
        forms in a single binding, <i>i.e.</i> it both defines an abbreviation and binds a
        single keystroke to it.
        </p>
                 
        <p>
        Although they inherit the bindings of text-editing windows, minitexts
        have three additional possible bindings that override these, whose
        default forms are shown below:
        <pre>
        <code>minitext action doTellBig   ENTER</code>  
        <code>minitext action doBig       ctrl  ENTER</code> 
        <code>minitext action doClear     ctrl  U</code> 
        </pre>   
        The first of these binds ENTER to a warning that a minitext has
        a single-line-view editor. The second binds control-ENTER to an action
        that attaches a multiline-view editor to the minitext.
        </p>
        </li>
        
        <br></br>
        
        <li>The main editing session window. There
        is just one of these per editing session; its behaviour is defined by the class
        <tt>org.sufrin.dred.EditorFrame</tt>. Bindings take one of the forms
        <pre>
        <code>editor          action</code> <i>EditorActionName</i> <i>keystroke description</i>
        <code>editor minitext action</code> <i>EditorActionName</i> <i>keystroke description</i>
        </pre>
        The first of these binds the same keystroke to the given editor action
        in the document-editing window as well as in the minitexts. The
        second form binds only in the minitext windows. Its principal
        purpose is to enable <tt>TAB</tt> to be used as a ''filepath
        completion'' key in the minitext windows but to insert spaces
        in the main document-editing window.
        
        <p><i>  The document-editing window inherits the text action and
        text abbreviation bindings, but not the minitext-specific
        bindings.  </i></p>
        </li>     
</ul>

<h4>A few example Bindings</h4>
<pre>
<code>
   text   action doAbbrev         ESCAPE
   text   action doInsertTab      TAB           # insert spaces up to next tab position
   text   action doIndentNewline  ENTER         # insert newline and indent to current margin
   text   action doInsertNewline  ctrl ENTER    # insert newline stay at left margin     
   text   abbrev forall           \u2200        meta shift A # ∀   
   text   abbrev exists           \u2203        meta shift E # ∃      
   text   key    \u03B3   meta G                # (gamma) γ       
   text   key    \u0393   meta shift G          # (Gamma) Γ        

   editor minitext action doComplete   TAB      # not in the main window
   editor          action doFindDown   F9
   editor          action doFindUp     shift F9
</code>
</pre>
<a name="bindings"/>
<h4>Further documentation of Bindings</h4>
<p>     Clicking on the <tt>Help/Show Bindings</tt> menu item provides
        documentation for the built-in actions. Clicking on the
        <code>Help/Insert Bindings</code> menu item inserts the prototype
        of a bindings file into the document currently being edited. This
        is intended to make it easy to construct an alternative bindings
        file. The prototype shows the existing bindings, and can be
        edited into the right form and saved in the right place.
</p>

<h4>Keystroke Specifications</h4>
Keystroke specifications take the form of zero or more optional modifiers followed by a 
<i>key specification</i>:
<pre>
                <code> [ctrl][alt][meta][shift][altGraph] <i>key specification</i></code>
</pre>
A <i>key specification</i> takes one of the forms
given in the documentation for <tt>java.awt.event.KeyEvent</tt>, but without the
<tt>VK_</tt> prefix. Be aware of peculiarities of keyboard interpretation
that mean that to specify a modified variant of a character that appears 
in the shift position on a key, you have to specify the
shifted variant of the character that appears in the unshifted position.
For example: <code>alt LEFT_PARENTHESIS</code> is an invalid 
keystroke specification, and the keystroke you get by pressing <tt>alt</tt> with <tt>(</tt> 
has to be expressed as <code>alt shift 9</code>.

Also beware that on some keyboards the <tt>alt</tt> and
<tt>meta</tt> keys are indistinguishable, and that some X window managers
pre-empt some keystroke combinations for their own purposes.

<h3>Alternative and Additional Bindings</h3>

<A name="hood"> 
Under the hood
</A>
</h2>
<h3>Server Mode</h3>
<p>
The program can be started in ''server'' mode, by invoking:
</p>
        
<pre>
        java -jar Dred.jar -socket=####
</pre>
<p>
in which case it listens to the socket with the given number for
HTTP1.0 requests to start editing sessions. 
</p>

<p>A request takes the form:
</p>

<pre>
        GET /edit?CWD=workingdirectory&amp;FILE=absolutefilename
</pre>

<p>
The server starts an editing session for the given file using the
given working directory as the session's effective working directory.
</p>

<p>When the session is terminated an HTTP response is generated.
A process that listens for the HTTP response can be sure that the
editing session has terminated when it gets it, but there's no
need for the invoking process to wait.
</p>

<p> The python script: led/ted is a (fairly) good example of a program
that provides a simple command-line interface for the Dred server.  </p>

<h2>Reference</h2>
<p>The Dred document editing model is essentially that established in my
(1981) Science of Computer Programming paper: 
''Formal Specification of a Display-Oriented Text Editor''.
