<p> Dred is a <i>lightweight</i>, customizeable, and extensible Unicode text
editor. It comes, complete with documentation, in a single (256K) jar, and needs
a 1.5 JRE to run.
</p>

<a name="Unix/Linux Usage"><h2>Unix/Linux Usage</h2></a>
<pre>
        java -jar Dred.jar [--enc=<i>encoding</i>] [--bindings=<i>bindings-url</i>] --wait <i>files</i> 
</pre> 
or 
<pre>
        java -jar Dred.jar [--enc=<i>encoding</i>] [--bindings=<i>bindings-url</i>] -w <i>files</i> 
</pre>
or        
<pre>
        ted [--enc=<i>encoding</i>] [--bindings=<i>bindings-url</i>] <i>files</i>
</pre>  
<p> This starts edit sessions for each of the files. The
program exits when the last session terminates.  
</p>

<pre>
        java -jar Dred.jar [--enc=<i>encoding</i>] [--bindings=<i>bindings-url</i>] <i>files</i>  &amp;
</pre>  
or        
<pre>
        dred [--enc=<i>encoding</i>] [--bindings=<i>bindings-url</i>] <i>files</i>
</pre>  
<p>
This starts edit sessions for each of the given files, <i>using the user's
existing Dred server if one is running</i>, then exits immediately. If no
server is running then it starts itself in server mode, puts up an
(iconified) server control, and starts edit sessions for the
filenames. 



Files are usually specified by paths in the local filestore, but can also be specifed by URL: 
see <a href="#Opening a URL">Opening a URL</a> for details.  
</p>

<p>
If  <tt>--bindings=...</tt>
is specified then the editor's bindings are taken from the file
specified by the given URL; otherwise the default bindings
are used. If <tt>--enc=...</tt> is specified, then
the files are assumed to use the specified encoding; otherwise UTF8 is assumed.
</p>
      
<p>

<A href="Underhood.html">Under the Hood</A>)
</p>

<br></br>

<a name="Windows (XP) Usage"><h2>Windows (XP) Usage</h2></a>

Put the Dred.jar somewhere sensible, and make a shortcut to it whose target and
start-in fields looks something like this:
<pre>
Target:   C:\WINDOWS\system32\javaw.exe -jar "C:\Documents and Settings\sufrin\Desktop\DRED\Dred.jar" 
Start in: "C:\Documents and Settings\sufrin\Desktop"
</pre>
Doubleclicking this shortcut starts a new Dred in an editing session with an
anonymous document; dropping a file onto it starts a new Dred in an editing
session for that file. 

<p> You may want to put a <tt>dred.bindings</tt>
file in the installation directory once you have found out a bit more
about bindings. When you have done so, add the following text to the
shortcut target, just before the -jar switch:
<pre>
-DDREDBINDINGS="C:\Documents and Settings\sufrin\Desktop\DRED\dred.bindings" 
</pre>
</p>

If you really care about economy, then read
 <A href="Underhood.html">Under the Hood</A>
for details of how Dred can be set up to use a single
server. It's slightly trickier under Windows XP2, which tries
hard to prevent "Trojan" ports being opened. The bottom line is
that you should choose port number (####) above 8000 that you know won't be used by
any other server, and change the shortcut to:

<pre>
Target:   C:\WINDOWS\system32\javaw.exe -jar "C:\Documents and Settings\sufrin\Desktop\DRED\Dred.jar" --serve==####
</pre>


<a name="The Dred Editing Session Window"><h2>The Dred Editing Session Window</h2></a>
<p> In each editing session window you will see the main text editing
component at the bottom, with three &quot;minitext&quot;-editing
components in a row above it. The minitexts are labelled
&quot;....&quot; (pronounced &quot;Argument&quot;), &quot;Find&quot;
and &quot;Repl&quot;. 

<p> The <i>Find</i> and <i>Replace</i> minitexts provide arguments for
the actions of the same name. The little checkboxes next to
them indicate whether they are interpreted as "regular expression" or
"literal".</p>

<p> The <i>Argument</i> minitext provides arguments for many of the other
editing commands, including those on the <i>File</i> menu which start
new editing sessions, allow the document to be saved in a different file,
and so forth.  </p>

<p>
Many of the editing commands described below 
are bound to keys, and can also be used on the minitexts.
</p>

</p>
<p>Dred shows which of its (mini-)text windows has the keyboard focus
by showing its cursor in red. A text window with a greyed-out cursor
doesn't have the keyboard focus.  Focus usually moves into a text window
as the mouse-cursor moves into it, but occasionally after
popup warnings it's necessary to force the issue by clicking in the desired window.  
</p>

<a name="Editing Model"><h2>Editing Model</h2></a>

<p> At any stage, the document in a window (minitext or main) may have
a <i>selection</i> (which is a contiguous region of the document).
It is bounded at one end by the <i>document cursor</i> -- which is shown
as a thin red rectangle -- and at the other end by the <i>mark</i> --
which is shown as a thin green rectangle. When the cursor and mark are
in the same position only the cursor is shown, and the selection (in that
document) is effectively empty.</p>


<p>The document cursor is moved by the arrow keys. It can be placed
anywhere in the document by clicking with the left mouse-button.  The mark
can be placed anywhere in the document by clicking on the right mouse
button. </p>


<p>The selection is always shown on a grey background.</p>

<p> After every editing action the position of the document in the
editor window is adjusted automatically so that <i>the document cursor
is visible.</i> Between editing commands the position of the  document
in the window can be adjusted manually by the scroll bars, and this can
make the document cursor disappear temporarily.  </p>


<p> There is a <i>cut-buffer</i> which holds at most one text. It is
implemented by the system clipboard, and material placed in the cut
buffer is also available in the clipboard. Material placed in
the system clipboard by another application is accessible through the
cut buffer.  </p>

<a name="Editing Actions"><h2>Editing Actions</h2></a>
<p> The editing actions described below are a small selection of the
actions provided by the editor. Brief documentation for <i>all</i> the actions,
and indications of their current binding(s) to keys and/or Menu buttons
can be seen by pressing the <b>Help/Show Bindings</b> menu item. 
</p>
(see also <A href="Bindings.html">Further documentation of bindings</A>)


<h3>Cut and Paste</h3>
<p>The <i>Cut</i> action removes the selection from the document and puts
it in the cut-buffer.  The <i>Paste</i> action inserts the content of
the cut-buffer into the document and re-selects it. The <i>Copy</i> action
replaces the cut-buffer with the selection (if there is a selection),
and the <i>SwapSel</i> action exchanges the selection and the cut-buffer (except
that if the selection is null, then the cut-buffer doesn't change).  The
<i>SwapCursorAndMark</i> action does what its name suggests.
</p>

<h3>Search and Replace</h3>
<h4>
Search and Replace Basics
</h4>
<p>
The three minitexts at the top of an editing window are called the <i>....</i>
(or <i>Argument</i>),
the <i>Find</i>, and the <i>Replace</i> texts, respectively.
</p>

<p>
The <i>FindDown</i> action selects the next (<i>FindUp</i> previous) instance of the
pattern specified by the <i>Find</i> minitext. 
</p>
If the checkbox adjacent to the <i>Find</i> minitext is checked then
the pattern is interpreted as a regular expression, otherwise it is interpreted
literally.

<p> If the current selection is an instance of the Find text then the
<i>ReplaceDown</i> action saves the current selection in the cut-buffer
and replaces it with the (meaning of the) <i>Repl</i> minitext --
leaving the cursor to the right of the mark. The <i>ReplaceUp</i>
button is analogous and leaves the cursor to the left of the mark in
the replacement text.</p>

<p>The meaning of the  <i>Repl</i> minitext is the text itself
if the checkbox adjacent to it is NOT checked. Otherwise its meaning is
the text obtained by substituting each instance of <tt>$n</tt> in it
by the text that matched the <tt>n</tt>th bracketed expression in the 
instance of the pattern that is being replaced.
</p>

<p>The <i>FindUp</i> action is usually bound to the SHIFTED key that
the <i>FindDown</i> action is bound to; likewise the <i>ReplaceUp</i>
action is usually bound to the SHIFTED <i>ReplaceDown</i> key.  </p>


<p> The <i>FindSelDown</i> action makes the current selection the
<i>Find</i> pattern, turns off regular expression interpretation,
and then acts as the <i>FindDown</i> action. Likewise
<i>FindSelUp</i> makes the current selection the <i>Find</i> text,
then acts as the <i>FindUp</i> action.  </p>

<p>The <i>ClearArgument</i> action moves the keyboard focus
into the <i>Argument</i> minitext area and erases the text that is
there. <i>ClearFind</i>, and <i>ClearRepl</i> behave analogously in the
<i>Find</i> and <i>Repl</i> minitexts. 
</p>

<h4>
Search and Replace in Practice
</h4>
<p>
One way of replacing the next instance of
"FOO" with "BAR" is to type the keystrokes bound to
<pre>
      <i>ClearFind</i> F O O <i>FindSelDown</i> <i>ClearRepl</i> B A R <i>ReplaceDown</i>
</pre>
Replacing the following instance just requires 
<pre>
      <i>FindSelDown</i> <i>ReplaceDown</i>
</pre>
since the <i>Find</i> and <i>Repl</i> minitexts are already 
set to the right pattern and replacement.
</p>

<p>
        The <i>ReplaceAll</i> action replaces (without any interaction) all
        instances of the <i>Find</i> minitext within the current selection
        with the <i>Repl</i> minitext, and selects the resulting transformed
        text. The original selection is preserved in the cut buffer, so
        this action can be undone with <i>SwapSel</i>.        
</p>
<p>
        If you want to "approve" each replacement interactively,
        then just use <i>FindSelDown</i> <i>ReplaceDown</i> in sequence
        repeatedly, undoing any replacement you don't approve of with
        <i>SwapSel</i>. 
</p>

<h3>Treatment of the Selection</h3>
Dred offers two modes of treating the selection. Most users will
decide on one of them and stick to it forever.
<ol>
       <li>
       <b>Typing-cuts-selection:</b> Typing new material automatically
       cuts the selection into the cut buffer. This is the behaviour
       that most people have come to expect of editors. 
       <br></br>
       In this mode Dred distinguish between three types of selection: 
       <ul>
         <li>
           <i>definite selections</i>: which are those made "manually"
           by the user with the mouse or cursor movement actions.
         </li>
         
         <li>
           <i>tentative selections</i>: which are those made automatically
           by Dred when its automatic bracket-matching is enabled. 
           A tentative selection is shown with a slightly
           lighter grey background than definite selections have.
         </li>
         
         <li>
           <i>mixed selections</i>: which arise when a tentative selection is
           extended manually. A mixed selection may be shown with a mix
           of backgrounds, or with the same colour background as
           definite selections have.
         </li>
       </ul>
       <br></br>
       Tentative selections are not cut when new
       characters are typed, whereas  mixed and definite selections are
       automatically cut when characters are typed.
       </li>
              
       <br></br>

       <li>
       <b>Typing-removes-mark:</b> Typing new characters removes the mark,
       and thus deselects the <i>selection</i>, but does not delete the
       selected material. In this mode Dred does not distinguish between
       tentative and definite selections.
       </li>
</ol>

The choice between treatments is made using the <b>File/Preferences/Typing&nbsp;Removes&nbsp;Selection</b>
checkbox. As with all other preferences its value is preserved between 
Dred invocations.

<h3>Undoing and the Cut Ring</h3>
<p>
Dred has no <i>general</i> mechanism for undoing, but all the commands
that insert, remove, or transform text are individually undoable.
</p>

For example: when the selection is non-null


<pre>
        <i>Cut</i>      is undone by <i>Paste</i> 
                
        <i>SwapSel</i>  is undone by <i>SwapSel</i>
</pre>
 
and (whether or not the selection is null)     
<pre>
        <i>Paste</i>    is undone by <i>Cut</i> 
</pre>
<p>
Moreover if the selection is an instance of the Find text then 
</p>

<pre>
        <i>Replace</i>  is undone by <i>SwapSel</i>
</pre>

<p> The <i>Cut Ring</i> records the last few pieces of material
that found their way into the cut buffer (the number is adjustable).
The cut ring can be accessed by opening the <i>Cut Ring Editor</i>:
this is a specialized  editor session that normally shows the content
of the cut ring. This editor session behaves in most respects like an
ordinary editing session so material can be transferred from it to any
other text window using <i>Copy</i> and <i>Paste</i>. (Of course the 
Cut Ring Editor  doesn't itself send material to the cut ring!)  
</p>

<h3>The Position Ring</h3>
As an <i>aide-memoire</i>, whenever a "big" movement action is executed
the position at which it was executed is appended to the <i>cut ring</i>
if it isn't already in the ring. The <i>Prev Position</i> action moves
the cursor to the last position in the ring and rotates the ring by one
step: the <i>Next Position</i> action is its inverse.  For the moment
the size of the ring is fixed at 8.

<h3>Markers</h3>
The characters with Unicodes <tt>fff0</tt> ... <tt>fffa</tt> (the
"specials" range) are treated as markers and are shown (in red) as
<strong style="color: red">❶, ❷, ... ❾, ❿</strong> (<i>i.e.</i>
single glyphs that resemble <strong style="color: red">(1), (2), ... (9),
(10)</strong>).  They are removed from the document as it is saved,
but otherwise treated the same as ordinary characters. They can be used
to mark places in the document to which you may wish to return. Don't
forget to bind keystrokes to them (I use <tt>ctrl 1</tt> ... <tt>crtrl
0</tt>). You'll find that the standard extension <tt>MarkTool</tt>
provides a menu which makes working with marks fairly easy. One way of
loading this extension is to add the following bindings to one of your
bindings files:
<pre>
           extension path class:/MarkTool/
           extension load MarkTool                  
</pre>
<h3>"Small" Changes</h3>
<p>
Any single character insertion can be undone by the <i>Delete</i> action.
</p>

<p>
When there is a nonempty selection in typing-cuts-selection mode,
the <i>Delete</i> action behaves exactly like the <i>Cut</i> action, and
can therefore be undone by the <i>Paste</i> action.
In all other circumstances it removes the character to the left of
the cursor from the document without affecting the cut buffer.
In any case the mark is removed, thereby deselecting the selection.
</p>

<p>
The  <i>Swap2</i> action swaps the two characters immediately to the left
of the cursor without affecting the cut buffer. It undoes itself.
</p>

<a name="Opening and Saving files"><h2>Opening and Saving files</h2></a>

<h3>Saving</h3>
When you have finished editing a file, you can save it using the <b>File/Save</b>,
or <b>File/Save&nbsp;As</b> menu entries or the corresponding shortcuts.
Dred saves a backup copy of the file in a file whose path is
made by appending a tilde "<tt>~</tt>" to the path of the original
file. If the "secondary backups" preference is enabled, and the single-tilde
backup file exists, then a double-tilde backup file is written. 

<p>
Dred is quite cautious about saving a file. If it looks like the file has
been written during the period that it has been being edited, then Dred will
warn you and ask you what to do. Likewise, if you <b>"Save&nbsp;As"</b> using the
name of an existing file, Dred will ask whether you really mean it.
</p>

<h4>Character Set Encoding</h4>
A file is usually saved in the character set encoding that it
originated in. It can be saved in a different encoding by
using the <b>File/Save&nbsp;As&nbsp;(Browse)</b> menu entry
and changing the encoding using the encoding selector provided
in the file browser. 

<h3>Opening</h3>
Use the <b>File/Edit&nbsp;....</b> menu entry with the name of
the file in the argument minitext, or use the <b>File/Edit&nbsp;(browse)</b> 
menu entry to start a new editing session. The browser opens in the 
current working directory of the editing session, which is usually that
from which the session was started.

<h4>Filename Completion</h4>
<p> The "filename completion" shortcut (usually TAB) in the argument
minitext causes the text in that minitext to change to the longest common
prefix of all the files in the <i>current scope</i> that start with the
existing value of the minitext.  
</p>


<ol>
     <li>
     If the minitext is empty, then a browser is opened in the current
     working directory (the directory from which the session was started).
     </li>
          
     <li>
     If the minitext looks like an absolute path then the current scope is the parent 
     of that path. 
     For example, the scope of the path <tt>/b</tt> is <tt>/</tt>, and the scope of 
     <tt>/b/</tt> is <tt>/b/</tt>
     </li>
     
     
     <li>
     If the minitext starts with <tt>./</tt> then the leading <tt>./</tt> is replaced by
     the absolute path of the current working directory of the editing
     session (which is usually the current working directory directory
     from which the session was started), and rule 2 is applied.
     </li>
     <li>
     If the minitext starts with <tt>../</tt> then the leading <tt>../</tt> is replaced
     by the absolute path of the parent of the current working directory
     of the editing session, and rule 2 is applied.
     </li>
     
     <li>
     In all other cases, the minitext is prefixed with <i>the parent
     path of the file being edited</i> in the current session, and rule
     2 is applied.
     </li>           
</ol>

<a name="Opening a URL"><h4>Opening a URL</h4></a>
<p>
Dred will do its best to read a filedenoted by URL, but it cannot yet <i>save</i> documents to locations 
specified by a URL. If you edit a URL-specified file, you will need to use <b>Save As</b> to save it
somewhere else. 

<br></br>

Protocols known to work (providing no credentials are required
for the file) are <tt>ftp:</tt> and <tt>http:</tt>

<br></br>

Dred has an additional protocol that gives it access to resources (such
as documentation and pre-designed bindings files) that come packaged
in its .jar file. To access such a file one prefixes its name with
<tt>dred:</tt>. Specific examples that might be useful are:

<code>
<pre>
   dred:/dred-bs.bindings
   dred:/function.bindings
   dred:/style.bindings
   dred:/symbols.bindings
   dred:/ctrl.bindings
   dred:/Manual.html
   dred:/Bindings.html
   dred:/Underhood.html
   dred:/index.html
   dred:/MarkTool.java
</pre>
</code>
</p>

<h4>Character Set Encoding</h4>
A file may be loaded using a specified encoding by using the
<b>File/Edit&nbsp;(Browse)</b> menu entry and changing the encoding
using the encoding selector provided in the file browser.

<a name="Fonts"><h2>Fonts</h2></a>
Dred usually uses the platform standard font known to Java as <tt>MONOSPACED 14</tt>.
But on some platforms this may lack glyphs for some of the Unicodes that you
need to use. So it is possible to set up Dred to use a different default font,
and it is also  possible to change the font used in a particular session.

<p>
If the Java system property (or the environment variable)
<tt>DREDFONT</tt> is set, then it is interpreted as the specification
(in the standard Java font specification notation) of a standard Java font, unless
it takes one of the forms
<pre>
        truetype:<i>url</i> <i>options</i>
        type1:<i>url</i>    <i>options</i>
</pre>
In that case, the <i>url</i> (default protocol <tt>file:</tt>) is assumed to denote a (truetype or type1) 
font description file. 
</p>
<p>
The <i>options</i> are either empty, or take one of the forms
<pre>
       
        @<i>pointSize</i>
        @<i>pointSize</i>-<i>shape-options</i>
</pre>
When no point size is specified, the pointsize is taken to be 14.
</p>
The <i>shape-options</i> may include up to one of each of the following:
<pre>
        b[old]          # bold
        i[italic]       # italic
</pre>
and up to one of:
<pre>
        m               # <i>the font is deemed to be monospaced (char width is M-width)</i>
        f               # <i>the font is deemed to be monospaced (char width is M-width)</i>
        uXXXX           # <i>the font is deemed to be monospaced (char width is unicode XXXX-width)</i>
</pre>
The shape options are separated by "-".
<br></br>
Examples of font specifications are
<pre>
        MONOSPACED-14                                             #

<p>
The <b>View/Monospaced</b> menu checkbox switches Dred's rendering of a
proportionally-spaced font to and from a simulation of that used for a
monospaced font. The radiobuttons below it allow you to select (from a
small number of models) the character whose width is used to determine
the monospace pitch. This can be helpful if you want to work on material
containing glyphs that cannot be found in a monospaced font.
</p>

The <b>View/Set font to ...</b> and the <b>View/Set default font to ...</b> menu
entries change the font used in the current window (or that
used in the current windopw and all future windows) to the
font specified in the Argument (...) minitext. 

<p>
The <b>View/Antialising</b> checkbox controls the degree of effort Dred puts into
rendering characters. The only time I find antialiased rendering a little too slow for comfort
(on my 1.8mhz PIV) is when rendering certain heavily hinted Type1 fonts of the
kind that come with Acrobat Reader. Truetype fonts render more
than fast enough for my taste.
</p>

<a name="Preferences"> <h2>Persistent Preferences</h2> </a>
The  <b>File/Preferences</b> submenu displays many of Dred's 
preferences that persist between Dred invocations. Amongst these are
<li>
<li>Typing removes selection (or not)</li>
<li>Tooltips enabled</li>
<li>Secondary backups (saving generates a secondary backup if a primary backup exists)</li>
<li>Flat Look and Feel (if the slightly lurid Java standard turns you off)</li>
<li>Save Preferences on Exit (if you want preference settings to be persistent)</li>
</li>

<p>
The bracket-matching settings on the <b>Edit</b> menu, and the
<b>Antialiasing</b> setting on the <b>View</b> menu are also persistent.

<h4>Interrupting long-running tasks</h4>
The <i>KillProcess</i> action, invoked by pressing the little red
button at the bottom right of the frame,  will abort a long-running
search or external process. If you're editing an enormous file and have
bracket-matching enabled, then a search for a matching opening or closing
bracket might take a very long time.  The symptom of this is the "wait"
cursor appearing over the main editing window, and the stop button's
background turning red.

<h4>Unicode</h4>
<p>
A good starting point for matters Unicode is Markus Kuhn's
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html"> UTF-8 and Unicode FAQ for Unix/Linux</a>
</p>
<p>
A Truetype font that implements a very large proprtion of the Unicode
set is Microsoft's Arial Unicode. Microsoft no longer distribute
this font, but Googling <tt>arialuni.ttf</tt> is sure to help you
find it. Although it may cost you nothing, this font is not free.... 
It also occupies about 24mb, and <i> has fewer mathematical
symbols then many of the standard Java fonts</i>.
</p>

<h4>What's Flaky?</h4>

<p>
One thing that needs improving is the bracket matching for
XML: it uses inadequate machinery, and gets upward matches wrong
more often than not in files in which opening tags are split between lines.
(On the other hand it's fine for HTML editing)
</p>
<p>
The core document implementation is very robust, but at the price of making some
kinds of search slower than they might be. One day ....
</p>
<h4>What's needs more Documenation?</h4>
<p>
You name it! The Extension API is completely undocumented at present. Only
by reading the source code and the JavaDoc can you .....

<a name="Brief History"><h2>Brief History</h2></a>

Dred was written in Java 1.5 during between early February and mid-April 2005 because:
<ol>
    <li>
    I needed a run-anywhere lightweight and reliable editor
    capable of working with files in any reasonable encoding. 
    </li>    
    <li>
    When the combination of Python and Tk had become a little too unwieldy
    for me I had given up trying to maintain the Unicode-capable editor
    that I'd been using for a decade. I had originally written it to
    support editing Jape theories in the (highly nonstandard) 8-bit
    encodings Konstanz and Laura that we developed before the advent
    of Unicode.
    </li>    
    <li>
    I wanted to experiment with a design that can use the selection 
    more creatively than the now-ubiquitous <i>"typing deletes the selection but you can 
    rescue yourself with undo"</i>. 
    </li>
    <li>
    I wanted to show my students a simple but useful example
    of the model-view-controller pattern.  
    </li>
    <li>
    I wanted to see if I could simplify the construction and
    documentation of the GUI by using Java 1.5 annotations.
    </li>
</ol>
I've been using it (mostly with Redhat 9, SuSe 9.2, and Solaris) for
all my editing since mid-February, and it hasn't crashed on me more than
twice nor lost me any significant amount of work.
<p>
It runs on the
Sun 1.5 JVM on all variants of Linux, Windows, and Solaris on which that
JVM can be installed. (<i>I don't know, nor much care, whether Apple
have gotten around to implementing their own Java 1.5 on MacOS-X. Their
idiosyncratic Java implementations have, in the past, wasted a great
deal of my time.</i>)
