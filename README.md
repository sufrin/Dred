Dred
====

(May 2017)

A modeless text editor built along the lines explored in my 1982 paper: "Formal Specification of a DIsplay-Oriented Text Editor" (Science of Computer Programming).

Dred was written in Java 1.5 between early February and mid-April 2005 because, having given up trying to maintain a decade-old editor I'd written in Python+Tk, I needed a run-anywhere lightweight and reliable editor that I could use to edit UTF8-encoded Jape theories. I had tried a number of public domain editors written in Java, but found that they made editing mathematical texts quite tedious, had very long startup times, or were insufficiently customizeable for me.

I've been using Dred (on various x86 Linux distros, Solaris, OS/X (Tiger, Snow Leopard, Lion), and Windows) for all my editing since mid-May (2005), and have found it completely reliable.

It runs on the (Sun/Oracle) Java 1.5 and later JVMs on all variants of Linux, Windows, and Solaris on which they can be installed.

Remark (May 2017): I recently implemented pdfsync compatibility, and did some maintenance enabling the editor to run on OS/X with Java 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, and to use recent variants of subversion. In doing so I corrected a couple of long-unnnoticed bugs.
